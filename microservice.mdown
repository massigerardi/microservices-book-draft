## Prologue

> Divide et impera

A spectre is haunting present architecture design.

But, differently from the spectre of early 20th century, no one is entered in a holy alliance to exorcise it.
No pope, no tzar, no Metternich and Guizot.

On the contrary the software development community is more and more embracing the new concept of microservices.

And why this should not occur? Microservices seems to offer at the moment undeniably advantages in terms of software architecture and in software development.

Scope of this book is to give an insigth into this new approach and to provide a working example of microservices in the real world.
